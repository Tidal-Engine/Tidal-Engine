# Tidal Engine Mission (Lite)

Tidal Engine is a high-performance voxel engine that empowers mod developers to create immersive game experiences through a comprehensive LuaJIT modding API, combining C++ core performance with the flexibility to build everything from simple block games to complex multiplayer worlds.

Tidal Engine delivers the performance mod developers and game creators need through its C++ core architecture while providing the flexibility they want via high-performance LuaJIT scripting. Unlike competitors that sacrifice performance for ease of use or require extensive C++ knowledge for advanced features, Tidal Engine uniquely combines near-native scripting performance with an approachable API that enables rapid development of complex voxel-based games and mods.
